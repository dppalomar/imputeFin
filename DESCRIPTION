Title: Imputation of Financial Time Series with Missing Values
Version: 0.1.0
Description:  Missing values often occur during the time series data 
    collection process. When missing values appear, the traditional 
    data analysis methods based on complete data cannot be appled. 
    One promising way to solve this problem is to impute the missing
    values. This package provides an efficient way to impute the 
    missing values based on autoregressive(AR) models.
