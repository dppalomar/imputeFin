#' portfolioBacktest: Backtesting of a Portfolio Over Multiple Datasets
#'
# 'Backtesting of a portfolio in a sliding-window fashion over a 
# 'dataset of stock prices. Multiple datasets are allowed (e.g., taken 
# 'randomly over different markets, different time periods, and different
# 'subset of the stock universe). In addition, multiple portfolios can be
# 'backtested for a subsequent comparison and ranking on a number of 
# 'criteria including expected return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, maximum 
# 'drawdown, turnover rate, return on investment, computational time, etc.
# 'The portfolio is defined as a function that takes as input a window of 
# 'the stock prices and outputs the portfolio weights. This package can be 
# 'useful for a researcher/practitioner who wants to backtest a set of 
# 'portfolios over a multitude of datasets over different markets. In 
# 'addition, it can be particularly useful to evaluate students in a 
# 'portfolio design course where the grading is based on the performance.
